# ReyBOT v0.0.1

ReyBOT is a custom Minecraft bot designed as a personal sidekick for singleplayer worlds—created to follow your lead, protect you from hostile mobs, mine ores, chop trees, and make your world feel more alive.

## 📌 What ReyBOT Does

- Follows you by default
- Guards and protects you by detecting and fighting hostile mobs nearby
- Mines ores (like coal, iron, etc.)
- Chops down trees for resources
- Automatically eats when hungry
- Automatically equips armor if you give it to him
- Sleeps automatically at night (just place a bed near him)
- Can duel (PvP) with you if commanded (perfect for training or for fun)

## 🚧 Limitations

- May automatically disconnect or left the game if hit by a creeper explosion (even without dying)
- Tree chopping and ore mining aren't fully smooth — Reybot sometimes pauses, but will retry after ~5 seconds
- During PvP with you, if auto-eating triggers, it may switch from sword to food and punch with it instead

## 🙌 Why I'm Building This

Playing alone in singleplayer can sometimes feel empty or lonely. I built ReyBOT to change that—to give players a helpful bot/s who follows, protects, and interacts with them. It's not just about automation, it's about making your world feel alive and less lonely.

This project also helps me build practical JavaScript and Node.js skills, especially in real-world-like environments.
